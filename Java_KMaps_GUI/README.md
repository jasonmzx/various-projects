** Karnaugh Maps Solver | Swing Application **
*Inspired by my Digital Systems class at University, and some friends that are currently making games*

- Written using an older version of Java `(JavaSE-1.8)` with Java's AWT & Swing packages (Built-in).

I'm tracking the amount of time I work on this project for time-management insights aswell:

| Date | Time Spent (Hours) | Accomplished |
|------|--------------------|--------------|
|   January 29th 2023   |       1.5 Hours    | Basic Setup, GitHub Upload, and fleshing out some classes |
|      |                    |              |
|      |                    |              |
